# Enemies Shooter 2D Game
Use w, s, a & d keys to move the player & use the left mouse button to shoot the enemies.

# How to build this project?
Set the Solution Configurations to Debug Mode & set the Solution Platform to x86. It is Dynamically Linked. So, you have to just copy all the DLL files from Dependencies folder & paste it into your exectable binary file location. 
That's it! then just build the project & Have Fun!
