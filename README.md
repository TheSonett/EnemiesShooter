# Space Shooter
Use w, s, a & d keys to move the player & use the left mouse button to shoot the enemies.

# How to build this project?
This project's target platform is x86. After building the project, if you try to run the program, you'll get some DLL file missing errors. Because, it is dynamically linked project. 
So it expects some important DLL files of sfml. You have to copy all the DLL files from bin folder & paste it into your exectable binary(x86) file's location.
That's it! Build the project again & Have Fun!
